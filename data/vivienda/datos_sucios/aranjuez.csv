The Royal Site and Villa of Aranjuez is located south of the Community of Madrid, from whose capital -Madrid- it is 47 kilometers by road or rail, the same ones that separate it from Toledo. The municipal area is the second largest in the region, covering an area of 19,000 hectares and its average altitude is 490 meters above sea level. The municipality is located in a wide plain formed by the confluence of the Tajo and Jarama rivers. This means that, even though it is inland, Aranjuez enjoys a temperate climate. The strong personality of Aranjuez is defined by its vegetal landscape, large and lush gardens, groves and forests on the banks of the Tagus and Jarama; long groves of trees on the main streets of the town; fertile irrigated orchards in the plains crisscrossed by canals and irrigation ditches since ancient times; Extensive dry lands frame a harmonious complex, wisely ornamented with monuments by the hand of man. It is already cliché, but it is a reality, to say that Aranjuez constitutes an orchard in the middle of the arid plateau. The urban complex of Aranjuez presents two well-differentiated but complementary cities: to the north, the Royal Palace and the Gardens, the monumental area; To the south, the Villa, whose Old Town, with a baroque layout, has been declared a Historical-Artistic Site. Aranjuez with almost 60,000 inhabitants is becoming an emblematic site for new cultural and gastronomic projects and is preparing to be a world reference in the field of Signature cuisine with its MAGIC university, from which Spain's future Michelin stars will come.","{'hasParkingSpace': True, 'isParkingSpaceIncludedInPrice': True}",False,40.0608834,False,6
