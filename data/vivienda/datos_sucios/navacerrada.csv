That house that, when you pass by, you think: whose will it be? would you sell it? The property originally dates back to 1950 and has been completely renovated 5 years ago. With the traditional construction of the time we find wide stone walls, wooden beams, clay and wooden floors. The rehabilitation has respected the essence of the property, preserving these traditional elements, as well as the fireplace in the living room with its original tiles, the wooden access door, the wrought iron bars on the door and windows, and the interior carpentry.. . The property is distributed over two floors: on the ground floor we have a large hall/distributor that leads to a large 35 m2 living room with a fantastic fireplace where you can shelter from the cold in winter, in a really cozy space; a large, fully equipped independent kitchen and a guest toilet. On the second floor we have a beautiful hallway with natural light that gives access to 4 double bedrooms with built-in wardrobes and a full bathroom (with the possibility of enlarging the master bedroom and incorporating another en-suite bathroom, sacrificing one of the rooms). In short, a unique opportunity to acquire a property of these characteristics in the center of Navacerrada, completely renovated, with heating and hot water by biomass and with an A energy rating.
