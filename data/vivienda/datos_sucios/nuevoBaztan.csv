The most public part has a large dining room, with windows facing two directions (east-west), and once we cross this large space, we find a second, more intimate dining room, linked to the kitchen. The kitchen is very large and has an office area, a large pantry and direct access to the garden. On the other hand we find the ground floor area intended for a more private use, where we find 5 bedrooms, an office and 2 full bathrooms.

The upper floor is divided into two areas. The first, like the ground floor, has 2 bedrooms and a full bathroom. The second is a large room that now functions as a games room and will delight the little ones, or it can be converted into a living-study area.
