They represent a reaction against purified mid-century modernism, in favor of ""playful embellishment and radical experimentation with form."" Personal expression and individuality were the hallmarks of the time. In architecture, the use of unconventional materials such as glass, wood and concrete was very common. In addition, the integration of the buildings into the surrounding natural landscape was sought, which gave rise to designs that had a strong relationship with the environment. The lake house of almost 900 m2 (including pool and garage) and on a beautiful and wooded plot of almost 5000 m2, was built by the German architect Kurt Schäffer known for his designs of straight lines, high ceilings, huge windows with in order to integrate outdoor nature by creating beautiful works of art seen through the glass, and on this occasion, using wood, iron, concrete and stone.
