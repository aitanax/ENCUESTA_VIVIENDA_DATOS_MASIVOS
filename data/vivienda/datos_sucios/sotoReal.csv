In the last decades it has had an impressive urban development that has taken it from having 421 inhabitants in 1960 to about 8,000 current ones. This urban development has been based on urbanizations. These in their beginning were colonies of low houses and squared plot. Later the model changed to massive housing developments, which make up the majority urban landscape in this town. The construction of blocks of flats has been minority, and largely at the expense of the old houses of the town, of which there are only a few examples. In 1998 the center of the town was remodeled, creating a new town hall and a new town square completely pedestrian. The municipal sports center with indoor pool, gymnasium and tennis courts was also inaugurated. In recent years, the Arroyo del Valle viaduct has been built as part of the Madrid-Valladolid line of the AVE.
